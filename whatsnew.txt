V0.6

Added:
- CameraToTex: cubemapping will be easier.
- Constructive Solid Geometry: with command MeshCSG it's possible to combine, subtract or intersect two meshes
- Stencils: things like mirrors or portals are possible
- UVW mapping: with the command UpdateTexCoords, the second texture map of a surface will be replaced with a UVW texture map, to apply materials (3D textures)
- Materials: they are 3d textures, that can be stored in multiframe pictures (just like animated textures: they can be load with a similar syntax). Materials cannot be used on a surface directly, but they can be used in a shader template that can be applied to a surface. UVW data will be used to map it.
- Voxel sprites: they are solid, and can be created from a material (as a 2D sprite can be created from a texture)

Fixed:
- a bug in TFormPoint: it didn't work correctly when a source entity and a destination entity were specified at the same time
- a cubemap bug.
- Some memory leaks (Thank D.J.Peters)
- a bug in shadows: distance from the light was not computed correctly.

V0.5

Added:
- Shader support
- Command RepeatMesh: creates a new mesh using surfaces of another one: any change to surface of one mesh will affect its clones, too.
- LightRange now affects shadows, too.
- MeshCullRadius now works
- LoadAnimTextures now can extract frames from more than one strip.

Fixed:
- fixed a bug in FreeEntity that caused memory leaks
- Shadow anomalies: should be fixed
- Mesh attached to animated bones were updated only when the animated mesh was turned/moved. Fixed.
- CreateCylinder (solid mode)
- EntityParent: when parenting to 0, scale was not restored
- TranslateEntity: it worked in the wrong way. Fixed.
- MeshesIntersect: fixed
- Cleaned the source (thanks to D.J. Peters)
- CopyEntity terrain: if entitytype was set, it crashed. Fixed.
- CopyEntity terrain: now brush info are copied, too.
