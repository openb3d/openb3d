V0.5

Added:
- Shader support
- Command RepeatMesh: creates a new mesh using surfaces of another one: any change to surface of one mesh will affect its clones, too.
- LightRange now affects shadows, too.
- MeshCullRadius now works
- LoadAnimTextures now can extract frames from more than one strip.

Fixed:
- fixed a bug in FreeEntity that caused memory leaks
- Shadow anomalies: should be fixed
- Mesh attached to animated bones were updated only when the animated mesh was turned/moved. Fixed.
- CreateCylinder (solid mode)
- EntityParent: when parenting to 0, scale was not restored
- TranslateEntity: it worked in the wrong way. Fixed.
- MeshesIntersect: fixed
- Cleaned the source (thanks to D.J. Peters)
- CopyEntity terrain: if entitytype was set, it crashed. Fixed.
- CopyEntity terrain: now brush info are copied, too.
